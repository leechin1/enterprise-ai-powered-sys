# Misty Jazz Records - Company Manifesto

## Our Vision

To preserve and celebrate the golden era of jazz through premium vinyl records, creating a sanctuary where music lovers can discover the authentic sound of jazz as it was meant to be heard.

## Our Mission

Misty Jazz Records is dedicated to curating the finest collection of jazz vinyl records, from bebop to cool jazz, from hard bop to modal jazz. We believe that vinyl isn't just a format—it's an experience that honors the artistry, warmth, and soul of jazz music.

## Core Values
