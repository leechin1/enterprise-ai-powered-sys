# Misty Jazz Records - Customer Service Standards

## Our Service Philosophy

Every customer interaction is an opportunity to share our passion for jazz and build lasting relationships. We're not just selling records—we're creating experiences and fostering a community of music lovers.

## Core Service Principles

### 1. Jazz Knowledge = Great Service
- **Know Your Catalog**: Be familiar with our inventory
- **Know Jazz History**: Understand artists, labels, and eras
- **Know Context**: Share stories that enrich the music
- **Never Fake It**: Say "let me find out" rather than guessing

### 2. Listen First, Sell Second
- **Understand Needs**: Ask questions before recommending
- **Read Cues**: Gauge customer knowledge level
- **Adapt Approach**: Casual browsers vs. serious collectors
- **Respect Budget**: Don't push expensive items inappropriately

### 3. Honesty Over Sales
- **Accurate Grading**: Never overstate condition
- **Fair Pricing**: Stick to posted prices
- **Authentic Info**: Correct pressing details
- **Set Expectations**: If reissue sounds different, say so

### 4. Create Community
- **Remember Names**: Use them in conversation
- **Recall Preferences**: "You liked that Coltrane last time..."
- **Build Relationships**: We're curators, not order-takers
- **Foster Connections**: Introduce like-minded customers
