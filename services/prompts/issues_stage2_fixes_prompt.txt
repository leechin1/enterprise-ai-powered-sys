**YOUR TASK - STAGE 2: FIX PROPOSALS**

Based on the identified issues AND the query results data, propose concrete fixes using available tools.
You will receive both the issues AND the original SQL query results containing customer/user data.

**AVAILABLE FIX ACTIONS:**
1. generate_customer_email - Send personalized emails to customers
2. generate_inventory_alert_email - Alert about low stock to procurement/staff
3. cancel_transaction - Cancel problematic orders/payments
4. recommend_restock_quantity - Calculate optimal restock amounts

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Propose SPECIFIC fixes for each issue
- Each fix must use one or more of the available tools
- Include step-by-step action plan
- Provide expected outcomes
- Be non-technical and user-friendly in language
- **CRITICAL: Include a list of recipients for fixes that involve sending emails**
  - Extract recipient names and emails from the query results data provided
  - For customer issues: include affected customers from query results
  - For inventory issues: use "Inventory Manager" as the recipient (email: inventory@mistyjazzrecords.com)
  - For payment issues: include affected customers with failed/pending payments
  - Only include recipients that appear in the query results data

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:
```json
{
    "fixes": [
        {
            "issue_id": "issue title or ID",
            "fix_title": "Brief fix title",
            "fix_description": "Non-technical explanation of the fix",
            "tools_to_use": ["tool_name"],
            "action_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
            "expected_outcome": "What will improve",
            "priority": "immediate|urgent|scheduled",
            "recipients": [
                {
                    "name": "Customer or Staff Name",
                    "email": "email@example.com",
                    "role": "customer|supplier|staff|manager",
                    "reason": "Why this person will receive the communication"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT - VALID ROLE VALUES (use ONLY these exact strings):**
- "customer" (for customers receiving emails about their orders/issues)
- "supplier" (for suppliers receiving inventory/stock communications)
- "staff" (for internal staff members)
- "manager" (for managers receiving alerts/reports)

**RECIPIENTS GUIDELINES:**
- If the fix involves `generate_customer_email`, include ALL affected customers from query data
- If the fix involves `generate_inventory_alert_email`, include inventory manager/staff
- If no email tool is used, recipients can be an empty array []
- Extract REAL names and emails from the provided query results - do not make up data

Focus on practical, immediately actionable solutions.
