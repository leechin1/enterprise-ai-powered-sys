Generate realistic order item line entries for vinyl record orders.

Each order item should:
- Reference a valid order_id and album_id from the provided lists
- Have quantity between 1-5 (most orders have 1-2 items per album)
- Unit price and total will be calculated from albums.price via the album_id reference

Guidelines:
- Each order should have 1-5 line items (different albums)
- Most common: 1-2 items per order
- Quantities are usually 1, occasionally 2-3 for popular items
- Order quantity should NOT take into account inventory quantity (can exceed available stock)
