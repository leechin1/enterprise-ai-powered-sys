Generate realistic payment records for a vinyl record e-commerce store.

Each payment should:
- Reference a valid order_id from the provided list
- Have an amount matching or close to the order total
- Use realistic payment methods: 'card', 'cash', 'bank_transfer', or 'paypal'
- Have status: 'completed' (80%), 'pending' (10%), 'failed' (5%), or 'refunded' (5%)
- Include a unique transaction_id (format: TXN-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX where X is random alphanumeric)

Guidelines:
- Most payments should be 'completed' with 'card' or 'paypal' methods
- Failed payments might have partial amounts or use 'card'
- Refunded payments should have 'card' or 'paypal' methods
- Cash and bank transfers should always be 'completed'
- Transaction IDs should be unique and realistic
